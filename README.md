Web app utilizing cellular automata for randomized kingdom expansion in afroeurasia

Using cellular automata, a kindgom is given an initial location on the map. At each step, every cell on the border of a kingdom either colonizes neighbors or goes extinct. 
This is done based upon the vegetation, elevation, and a randomly assigned percent colonization variable inherent to each kingdom. Using random numbers, an extinction or 
colonization is enacted when a random number is greater than the calculated total colonization chance or total extinction chance. 

Working to add github supported web link which will go here <url> utilizing streamlit. 

To run the app, it will require downloading dependencies which will later be located in a file called requirements.txt.
